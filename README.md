# Introduction

Razor Live API comes with methods which are needed to perform CRUD operations on the RazorLive Database.
Since the central database is not created yet we will have test data to start using the methods.

# Prerequisites

You need to have mongodb and node installed in order to use the API.

To view the data you can use robomongo (Optional).

To set up the test data follow the Setting-Up-Test-Data guide.

# Methods

Razor Live comes with the following API methods which can be used to interact with the Razor Live database.

Method Name | Description
